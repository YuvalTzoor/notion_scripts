# Notion scripts 

A collection of Notion scripts that help me with my events.

Currently, there is a script that can change an icon of a page using a filter in two versions-
Version one is for changing one specific emoji on one page, and another is to change all the page's emojis that match the filter for the next nine weeks.

I used the Notion API documentary for this-

Remember to create an integration at your notion account and shere it with the relevant database!

# Updates
* 18/08/2023 - A script for bulk deletion (for the next nine weeks) of events by their title was added!
